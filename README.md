# OrchestrationLibrary

An XML library designed to parse the XML portion of BizTalk orchestration artifacts, giving developers easy access to internal shape properties and information.

This library is not built to act as a replacement editor, custom XLANG parser, or anything else - just a simple library for accessing orchestration information for whatever purposes you may have. We use it with ShoBiz , our BizTalk documentation tool, for extracting basic orchestration information for documentation purposes.
